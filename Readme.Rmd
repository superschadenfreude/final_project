# Cleaning Data Final project

##Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Summary
This file is intended to review the main process for the creation of the "tidy-data.txt" data tidyset.

##Contents
This repository contains the followinf documents:

* Readme.rmd
* run_analysis.R
* codebook.Rmd
* tidy-data.txt

##Data
The raw data comes from the International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living, download it from: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The folder obtained is: UCI HAR Dataset. 
This data is automatic download it with the script run_analysis.R. All copyrights are described on the codebook.rmd file.

##Descrption of each file

* Readme.rmd: Overview of the process for the creation of the "tidy-data.txt" data tidyset  

* run_analysis.R: The R script obtains and tidy the raw data as follows:
0.1 Read libraries
0.2 Check if data set is already downloaded and download it, if necessary.
0.3 Obtaining all the txt files
0.4 Remove unnecesary files from the list
0.5 Reads the txt files as data frames
0.6 Binding test, training & ID data
0.7 Labeling test, training & ID data
1.0 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.0 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.0 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data 4.0 Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5.0 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject called "tidy-data.txt"

* codebook.Rmd:contains the variables and the transformations to clean the information and obtain a tidy set data as required for the final project course cleaning data from coursera

#Outcome
A tidyfile "tidy-data.txt" with 180 rows and 68 columns.
